This was a test to see how well I could work with an API... Using AngularJS... 

As I hadn't touched AngularJS for quite some time, but had meaning to get back into it, I felt this would be a great opportunity to see how well my knowledge had stuck...

Turns out that it stuck, but my knowledge in pagination was out, and trying to access specific fields within the JSON were considerably muddled...

I was planning on adding pagination, linking the artists to their top tracks and also making it nice and pretty with BootStrap, but because I was strapped for time due to family commitments I was unable to complete the task at hand. I can only hope that what I managed to do under the circumstances was sufficient.

I may come back to this when I have ample time and complete this...
